Problem statement: Implement a program that lists all valid activity schedules for n days (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10) using Swimming, Running, and Football, with the rule: no two consecutive days can have the same activity.  
Hints: * This is a recursion problem.  
       * At each day, try the 3 activities but skip the one equal to the previous day's choice.
